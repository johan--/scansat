SCANSAT
The ScanSat is an autonomous CubeSat that is docked with a Dragon-sized spacecraft. Using magnetic propulsion to orbit around the main craft, the ScanSat is reusable, as the only consumable is electric power. Equipped with a camera, it captures images of the spacecraft as it physically approaches interesting phenomena. 

This project is solving the Deep Space CamSat challenge.
