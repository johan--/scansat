# SCANSAT
The ScanSat is an autonomous CubeSat that is docked with a Dragon-sized
spacecraft. Using magnetic propulsion to orbit around the main craft, the ScanSat is reusable, as the only consumable is electric power. Equipped with a camera, it captures images of the spacecraft as it physically approaches interesting phenomena. 

**This project is solving the [_Deep Space CamSat_](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/deep-space-camsat/) challenge.**

## Description
The ScanSat is an autonomous CubeSat that is docked with a Dragon-sized spacecraft. Using magnetic propulsion to orbit around the main craft, the ScanSat is reusable, as the only consumable is electric power. Equipped with a camera, it captures images of the spacecraft as it physically approaches interesting phenomena.

The application was developed on April 11-12, 2015 at [_San Fransisco 2015 space apps challenge Hackathon_](http://spaceappssf.weebly.com/).

# Deliverables
